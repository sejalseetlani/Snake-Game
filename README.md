# Snake-Game
A Project is based on java programming using data structure. The player controls a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up item , trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult and interesting.
